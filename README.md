# Doge-Tips

This is my tip calculator assignment for the CodePath Course, Swift for Designers.

- It took me 3 hours to make
- Optional tasks for CodePath
-- Changed app icon and launch image
- Optional tasks for fun
-- Random generated colors and Doge strings
-- Sliders rather than typing to increase speed of calculating tip
-- Dynamic and fun data based on sliders
